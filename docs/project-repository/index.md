As noted in the overview, you won't create a new Gradle project from scratch in IntelliJ for this assignment; nor will you create a Git repository from scratch. Instead, you'll accept a GitHub Classroom assignment, which will create a repository for you, based on a template; then you'll clone the repository using IntelliJ. As you do work on the assignment, you'll commit your work to your local repository, and push those commits (at least once, but preferably more than that) back to the remote repository in GitHub.

Please see the instructions in the following pages to create the repository in GitHub and clone it in IntelliJ.
