## Submission

As you work on your implementation, you should (of course) commit your work regularly to Git. In order for your work to be evaluated, _you **must** commit it to Git **and** push your commits to the remote repository in GitHub, by {{ site.deadline.submission }}._

## Elements 

The evaluation of your work on this assignment will be based on the following (most of these have partial credit available):

Compilation

: Do your implementation and test classes compile?

Completeness

: Does your implementation include all of the expected (non-stubbed) methods and constructors?

: Does your test class include at least one (non-stubbed) test method for each of the implementation methods and constructors that are expected to be tested?

: Do your test cases cover a sufficient range of input and expected output data values?

Correctness

: Does your implementation code pass your tests?

: Does your implementation code pass the instructor's tests? 

Conventions

: Does your code follow all of the standard letter-casing and naming conventions (per the [Sun/Oracle Java code conventions](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html){:target='_blank'} or the [Google Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html){:target='_blank'}) for Java classes, methods, fields, parameters, and local variables?

: Are your class members ordered and formatted in a reasonable, consistent manner, following the [Sun/Oracle Java code conventions](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html){:target='_blank'} or the [Google Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html){:target='_blank'} guidelines?

: Are your test methods named using a clear and consistent pattern?

Clarity

: Is the code written in a clear, direct fashion?

: If the code is commented, are the comments relevant and informative? 

## Feedback

Evaluation feedback will be provided in each student's private channel in Teams by {{ site.deadline.feedback }}.
