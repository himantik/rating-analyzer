In a real-world situation, you're typically expected to complete development tasks by writing code that conforms to some set of requirements or specifications---some having to do with the behavior of your implementation, and others having to do with the code you write (and the test cases you use) to _test_ your implementation. For this assignment, the following pages include specifications for each of these areas. These specifications frequently reference the [Javadocs of the `org.stats.RatingAnalyzer` interface]({{ javadocs }}org/stats/RatingAnalyzer.html){:target='_blank'} (also linked in the upper-right); you **must** read and follow the specifications stated in the Javadoc documentation **and** the following pages, in order to complete this assignment successfully.

Note that the use in these specifications of "**must**" and "**most not**" indicate elements that are **required** or **prohibited** (respectively) for satisfactory completion of this assignment. On the other hand, "_should_" and "_should not_" denote elements that are not strictly required or prohibited, but which may be used in grading to offset (partially) slight deficiencies in other areas, and---if the strict requirements are also satisfied---can raise the evaluation to a level _above_ the threshold for satisfactory completion.
