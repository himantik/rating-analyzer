The code you submit for this assignment **must be** _your own work_, executed individually---that is, not working with others, whether they are members of the cohort or not. We expect you to research (if necessary) the definitions of mean, median, and mode; you may even search for and find example implementations of those computations. However, while you are free to use such code _as an example_, please **do not** copy and paste it into your work on this project.

In purely practical terms, simply copying and pasting code written by someone else, in another context, almost never results in something that compiles and runs correctly. To be successful, you must understand the code well enough to make all necessary changes. If code is pasted without the programmer clearly understanding how it works, and how to modify it for their purposes, that's usually obvious to a reviewer. Even code that has been pasted and then modified to work often carries the "fingerprints" (in structure, naming, etc.) of the original.

In short, while you may find code written by others useful in exploring different approaches (array-based calculations, stream operations, etc.), and such a use is allowed, please **resist any temptation to copy and paste someone else's code** into your work on this assignment. Instead, take this assignment as an opportunity to exercise and demonstrate the skills you're building, in a project that incorporates elements from basic Java syntax, OOP, and software engineering principles and patterns.
